							Exercise - 4 (Tuples)


No.1	: Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given
	  list of non-empty tuples.
	
	  list = [(1, 2), (7, 4, 9), (0, 1, 8), (9, 2, 1)]
	  reslult_list = [(9, 2, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1, 8), (7, 4, 9)]

No.2	: Write a Python program to check a tuple is empty or not.





No.3	: Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a tuple. (Remember : Tuple is immutable(unchangeable)





No.4	: Write a Python program to print a specified tuple after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th elements. 
	  (Remember : Tuple is immutable(unchangeable).

No.5	: Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in decreasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given

	  reslult_list = [(7, 4, 9), (0, 1, 8), (1, 2), (9, 2, 1)]

No.6	: Write a Python program to find the repeated items of a tuple. 





No.7	: Write a Python program to check whether an element exists within a tuple.
